  abstract = {Modern Hardware Description Languages (HDLs) such as SystemVerilog or VHDL are, due to their sheer complexity, insufficient to transport designs through modern circuit design flows. Instead, each design automation tool lowers HDLs to its own Intermediate Representation (IR). These tools are monolithic and mostly proprietary, disagree in their implementation of HDLs, and while many redundant IRs exists, no IR today can be used through the entire circuit design flow. To solve this problem, we propose the LLHD multi-level IR. LLHD is designed as simple, unambiguous reference description of a digital circuit, yet fully captures existing HDLs. We show this with our reference compiler on designs as complex as full CPU cores. LLHD comes with lowering passes to a hardware-near structural IR, which readily integrates with existing tools. LLHD establishes the basis for innovation in HDLs and tools without redundant compilers or disjoint IRs. For instance, we implement an LLHD simulator that runs up to 2.4\texttimes{} faster than commercial simulators but produces equivalent, cycle-accurate results. An initial vertically-integrated research prototype is capable of representing all levels of the IR, implements lowering from the behavioural to the structural IR, and covers a sufficient subset of SystemVerilog to support a full CPU design.},

  abstract = {Developing Field-programmable Gate Array (FPGA) architectures is challenging due to
the competing requirements of various application domains and changing manufacturing
process technology. This is compounded by the difficulty of fairly evaluating FPGA
architectural choices, which requires sophisticated high-quality Computer Aided Design
(CAD) tools to target each potential architecture. This article describes version
8.0 of the open source Verilog to Routing (VTR) project, which provides such a design
flow. VTR 8 expands the scope of FPGA architectures that can be modelled, allowing
VTR to target and model many details of both commercial and proposed FPGA architectures.
The VTR design flow also serves as a baseline for evaluating new CAD algorithms. It
is therefore important, for both CAD algorithm comparisons and the validity of architectural
conclusions, that VTR produce high-quality circuit implementations. VTR 8 significantly
improves optimization quality (reductions of 15% minimum routable channel width, 41%
wirelength, and 12% critical path delay), run-time (5.3\texttimes{} faster) and memory footprint
(3.3\texttimes{} lower). Finally, we demonstrate VTR is run-time and memory footprint efficient,
while producing circuit implementations of reasonable quality compared to highly-tuned
architecture-specific industrial tools—showing that architecture generality, good
implementation quality, and run-time efficiency are not mutually exclusive goals.},
