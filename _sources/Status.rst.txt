Status
######

.. NOTE::
  This section is work in progress!
  The purpose is to create a summary of the metadata and status of each of the modules in the ecosystem,
  similarly to `paebbels.github.io: Python Projects - Summary <https://paebbels.github.io/Content/PythonDashboard.html>`__.
  However, instead of creating the shields and tables manually, here a Python script is used (see :ghsrc:`status.py`).

.. include:: Status.inc
